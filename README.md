# vocadb-video-downloader-new
A video downloader for VocaDB, download a list of Vocaloid PVs and extract them into music files

This is a reimplementation of [this repo](https://github.com/CXwudi/vocadb-video-downloader)

Development is done, everything is working now.

But big refactoring is still needed before it goes general available. If you really want to use it, contact me through Discord at CXwudi#3565
