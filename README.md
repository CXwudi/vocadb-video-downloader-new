# vocadb-video-downloader-new
A video downloader for VocaDB, download a list of Vocaloid PVs and extract them into music files

This is a reimplementation of [this repo](https://github.com/CXwudi/vocadb-video-downloader)

Development is done, but big refactoring is still needed before it goes general available. If you really want to use it, contact me through Discord at CXwudi#3565
