A video downloader for VocaDB, download a list of Vocaloid PVs and extract them into music files

This is a reimplementation of [this repo](https://github.com/CXwudi/vocadb-video-downloader)

Everything is done and working. 

But `vvd-downloader` and `vvd-extractor` are under a reimplementation. 

If you really want to use this program, contact me through email or Discord at CXwudi#3565
